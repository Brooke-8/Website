                <p>Hi, I'm Brooke!  
                    <br><br>  
                    I am an undergraduate student pursuing a bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering at the University of Ottawa. 
                    I have a huge interest in software and computer design and love creating things that I can use in my day-to-day life. 
                    It is important to me that all my projects are accessible so that others can build on and enjoy my work. To this end, 
                    I strive to write detailed documentation alongside each of my projects, but if you run into any difficulties, 
                    feel free to reach out to me using the contact links to the left.  
                    <br><br>  
                    Outside of programming, I currently work as a lifeguard and swim instructor. Swimming and aquatics are very close to my heart, 
                    as I was a competitive swimmer for 10 years. I also dabble in various forms of digital art, including painting and 3D modeling. 
                    One of my favorite mediums to work in is pixel art as it allows me to focus on color and composition!  
                    <br><br>  
                    On this website, you can find a collection of all my projects, as well as some hobbies I'm proud of, such as my pixel art &lt;3

            <p>Spectralization is a small game I created in Unity to test the 
                concept of controlling in game elements directly with audio from the desktop. It works by retrieving audio from a microphone input using
                NAudio libraries, then taking the spectrum data and using it to perform mathematical operations on the game elements. 
                <br><br>
                The goal of the game is to time your inputs to when the main visualizer spectrum is at its highest point. 
                There are 4 regions on the spectrum, each assigned to a key on the keyboard. When you press a key that region will be 
                highlighted and a score will be calculated based on how much of that regions spectrum was active during the press, this is then added to the final score.

            <p>I was on a competeitive swim team for a large portion of my life, so when I went university I wanted a way
                for me to continue swimming with proper practices. I came up with the idea of making a little program that could
                generate practices for me automatically. The generator is written in Java, and uses a nice little library called 
                <a href="https://github.com/LibrePDF/OpenPDF" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenPDF</a> to format the output directly to a pdf.
                <br><br>
                I designed the code to be loosely coupled and highly modular. A workout consists of an ordered collection of sets
                that each consist of an ordered collection of set components. The set class is an abtrasct class that can be extended
                to create types of sets. I have created a few set classes that I use, but you want to implement a new class you can! 
                <br><br>
                I am currently still actively adding new features so I don't have a full build of the program yet, but if you want to use it
                simply download the source code, change the Settings.java file as you wish, and then build and run the DocumentCreator.java file!

            <p>This was a project that I did as part of one of my courses in university. The purpose of the app is to allow
                a users to register as either an organizer or an attendee, and then schedule and sign up for events. On opening the 
                app a user can either input their email and password if they already have an account, or click the sign up button to
                redirect them to the sign up page and create an account. When creating their account, the user either selects to be an 
                attendee or an organizer. Once they have made an account they must wait for admin approval before they can login.
                <br><br>
                Logged in organizers can see a list of upcoming and past events for their company, as well as create and schedule their own new
                events. Logged in attendees can see a list of upcoming events that they are eligible to register for, and a list of events they have already
                registered for.
                <br><br>
                My contributions to the team included designing and implementing the database system the app uses with Google Firestore, designing and writing the 
                XML front end UI, and coding some of the back end logic. I also wrote and implemented multiple unit tests, and implemented CircleCI for continuous
                integration.

            <h2>Spreadsheet Calendar Template</h2>
            <p>
                I like to be organized, which means I like to keep track of all my upcoming events and due dates in some form of calendar.
                I have tried many different calendar apps and they all have one problem, adding events is tedious and annoying. I wanted a 
                program that was as easy to use as a physical whiteboard, but had all the benefits of a digital calendar. This is where spreadsheets come in.
                Google sheets was an easy way for me to quickly make a robust calendar that I could use and edit from any device, and could add and manage events
                simply by typing them into a cell.
