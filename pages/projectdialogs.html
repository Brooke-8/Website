    <p>Spectralization is a small game I created in Unity to test the 
        concept of controlling in game elements directly with audio from the desktop. It works by retrieving audio from a microphone input using
        NAudio libraries, then taking the spectrum data and using it to perform mathematical operations on the game elements. 
        <br><br>
        The goal of the game is to time your inputs to when the main visualizer spectrum is at its highest point. 
        There are 4 regions on the spectrum, each assigned to a key on the keyboard. When you press a key that region will be 
        highlighted and a score will be calculated based on how much of that regions spectrum was active during the press, this is then added to the final score.

    <h2>Swimming Workout Generator</h2>

    <p>I was on a competeitive swim team for a large portion of my life, so when I went university I wanted a way
        for me to continue swimming with proper practices. I came up with the idea of making a little program that could
        generate practices for me automatically. The generator is written in Java, and uses a nice little library called 
        <a href="https://github.com/LibrePDF/OpenPDF" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenPDF</a> to format the output directly to a pdf.
        <br><br>
        I designed the code to be loosely coupled and highly modular. A workout consists of an ordered collection of sets
        that each consist of an ordered collection of set components. The set class is an abtrasct class that can be extended
        to create types of sets. I have created a few set classes that I use, but you want to implement a new class you can! 
        <br><br>
        I am currently still actively adding new features so I don't have a full build of the program yet, but if you want to use it
        simply download the source code, change the Settings.java file as you wish, and then build and run the DocumentCreator.java file!

    </div>
    <p>This was a project that I did as part of one of my courses in university. The purpose of the app is to allow
        a users to register as either an organizer or an attendee, and then schedule and sign up for events. On opening the 
        app a user can either input their email and password if they already have an account, or click the sign up button to
        redirect them to the sign up page and create an account. When creating their account, the user either selects to be an 
        attendee or an organizer. Once they have made an account they must wait for admin approval before they can login.
        <br><br>
        Logged in organizers can see a list of upcoming and past events for their company, as well as create and schedule their own new
        events. Logged in attendees can see a list of upcoming events that they are eligible to register for, and a list of events they have already
        registered for.
        <br><br>
        My contributions to the team included designing and implementing the database system the app uses with Google Firestore, designing and writing the 
        XML front end UI, and coding some of the back end logic. I also wrote and implemented multiple unit tests, and implemented CircleCI for continuous
        integration.

    <h2>Spreadsheet Calendar Template</h2>
    <p>
        I like to be organized, which means I like to keep track of all my upcoming events and due dates in some form of calendar.
        I have tried many different calendar apps and they all have one problem, adding events is tedious and annoying. I wanted a 
        program that was as easy to use as a physical whiteboard, but had all the benefits of a digital calendar. This is where spreadsheets come in.
        Google sheets was an easy way for me to quickly make a robust calendar that I could use and edit from any device, and could add and manage events
        simply by typing them into a cell.
