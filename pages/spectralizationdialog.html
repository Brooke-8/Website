        <p>Spectralization is a small game I created in Unity to test the 
            concept of controlling in game elements directly with audio from the desktop. It works by retrieving audio from a microphone input using
            NAudio libraries, then taking the spectrum data and using it to perform mathematical operations on the game elements. 
            <br><br>
            The goal of the game is to time your inputs to when the main visualizer spectrum is at its highest point. 
            There are 4 regions on the spectrum, each assigned to a key on the keyboard. When you press a key that region will be 
            highlighted and a score will be calculated based on how much of that regions spectrum was active during the press, this is then added to the final score.
