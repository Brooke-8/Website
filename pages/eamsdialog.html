            <p class="projecttext">This was a project that I did as part of one of my courses in university. The purpose of the app is to allow
                a users to register as either an organizer or an attendee, and then schedule and sign up for events. On opening the 
                app a user can either input their email and password if they already have an account, or click the sign up button to
                redirect them to the sign up page and create an account. When creating their account, the user either selects to be an 
                attendee or an organizer. Once they have made an account they must wait for admin approval before they can login.
                <br><br>
                Logged in organizers can see a list of upcoming and past events for their company, as well as create and schedule their own new
                events. Logged in attendees can see a list of upcoming events that they are eligible to register for, and a list of events they have already
                registered for.
                <br><br>
                My contributions to the team included designing and implementing the database system the app uses with Google Firestore, designing and writing the 
                XML front end UI, and coding some of the back end logic. I also wrote and implemented multiple unit tests, and implemented CircleCI for continuous
                integration.
