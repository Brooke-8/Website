            <p>
                I like to be organized, which means I like to keep track of all my upcoming events and due dates in some form of calendar.
                I have tried many different calendar apps and they all have one problem, adding events is tedious and annoying. I wanted a 
                program that was as easy to use as a physical whiteboard, but had all the benefits of a digital calendar. This is where spreadsheets come in.
                Google sheets was an easy way for me to quickly make a robust calendar that I could use and edit from any device, and could add and manage events
                simply by typing them into a cell.
