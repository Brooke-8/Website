            <p class="projecttext">I was on a competeitive swim team for a large portion of my life, so when I went university I wanted a way
                for me to continue swimming with proper practices. I came up with the idea of making a little program that could
                generate practices for me automatically. The generator is written in Java, and uses a nice little library called 
                <a href="https://github.com/LibrePDF/OpenPDF" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenPDF</a> to format the output directly to a pdf.
                <br><br>
                I designed the code to be loosely coupled and highly modular. A workout consists of an ordered collection of sets
                that each consist of an ordered collection of set components. The set class is an abtrasct class that can be extended
                to create types of sets. I have created a few set classes that I use, but you want to implement a new class you can! 
                <br><br>
                I am currently still actively adding new features so I don't have a full build of the program yet, but if you want to use it
                simply download the source code, change the Settings.java file as you wish, and then build and run the DocumentCreator.java file!
